1. PROJECT PROPOSAL

The proposed project is a game called Overlapping Generatiions, OLG. It is based
on Professor Peter Diamond's OLG model for maximizing lifetime welfare:

2. INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

- Open the tarball:

  # tar xvf olg.tar.gz

- Open the game folder:

  # cd olg

- Build the game:

  # make

- Start the game:

  # ./olg

3. PLAYING INSTRUCTIONS

On execution the game will prompt for player's name. Further instructions
will be presented as needed.

4. PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The proposed project is a game called Overlapping Generatiions, OLG. It is based
on Professor Peter Diamond's OLG model for maximizing lifetime welfare:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlapping_generations_model#Diamond_OLG_Model

However the model was simplified so that there are no children, but multiple
turns t, t = {1 ... T}. A player must either labor, consume, deposit, withdraw,
invest or divest in each turn. The end goal is to maximize the amount of money
consumed. This is a simplified definition of lifetime welfare. The game will
consist of one human player and an AI player named Peter Diamond. 

5. GAME RULES

- Player versus computer AI, named Peter Diamond.
- 4 Player actions per turn:
	- labor (work), consume (leisure), deposit, withdraw, invest (rent out
	  capital for production) or divest.
- None of cash, savings or investments can ever go below 0 (no debt allowed).
  This is also known as a No-Ponzi-Scheme restriction, where you cannot borrow
  indefinitely from the future; I.E., end the game with negative assets.
- There are T turns in a game, where t = {1 ... T}, default is 30.
- A unit of cash is a dollar, a positive integer, default is 10.
- Winner is the one who consumed the most by the end of the game.
	Lifetime welfare is defined as the maximum amount of money consumed.
- Rock-paper-scissors weighting on actions, one action per turn.
	labor: cost = $1, payout = $2
	consume: cost = $2, payout = $1
	deposit: cost = $5, payout = $0, accrues 1% interest per turn
	withdraw: cost = $0, payout = $6 (max withdraw $6 per turn)
	invest: cost = $10, payout = $0, accrues 4% rate of return per turn
	divest: cost = $0, payout = $15 (max divest $15 per turn)

6. GAME AI                                                                                                                      
Where t = {1 ... T}
1. If cash is > (T - t + 1),                                                                                                 
   then consume                                                                                                              
2. Otherwise, if cash is >= const_invest + 1,                                                                                
   and total_wealth <= (T - t + 1),                                                                                          
   then invest                                                                                                               
3. Otherwise, if investments >= (T - t + 1) - cash,                                                                          
   and investments >= cost_divest                                                                                            
   then divest                                                                                                               
4. Otherwise, if cash <= (T - t + 1), then labor                                                                             
5. Otherwise, if cash >= 2, then consume                                                                                     
*NOTE: Always leave at least $1 in cash so you can labor.                                                                    

7. MACROECONOMIC THEORY BEHIND THE AI

- Maximize lifetime welfare; I.E. the amount consumed:
	- W = Lifetime Welfare (total amount consumed)
	- c_t = amount consumed in turn t, t = {1 ... T}
	- T = total turns in the game
	- NOTE: Always leave at least $1 in cash so you can labor.

	max W = c_0 + c_1 + ... + c_T 
	max W = 2*T, where consume_cost = 2

	- Range of c_t
		min c_t = 0, from depositing, withdrawing, investing or divesting
	    	c_t = 1, from laboring
		max c_t = 2, from consuming

	- Therefore:
		max W = (turns_remaining - cash_in_savings - cash_in_investments - 3_turns) * max c_t
	IE
		max W = ( (T - t) - cash_in_savings - cash_in_investments - 3 ) * 2

		max W = max lifetime welfare; IE max consumed
	
	- Intuitively, since you can at max consume $1 per turn you never
	  want to have more total wealth than there are turns left in the
	  game. This is called a rational strategy.
		
	- Winning strategy: The optimal, rational strategy is to always
	  keep enough total wealth equal to or lesser than the number of
	  turns remaining.

8. MICROECONOMIC THEORY BEHIND THE AI

- The case for working until you die:
  
  There are actually two ways to beat the AI. One is to make a deposit into
  your savings account as your very first move. Then alternatively consume
  and labor until you can make a withdrawal. After that, alternate between
  consumption and labor until the end of the game

  The second optimal, rational strategy is to alternante between consumption
  and labor for the entire game, making no other actions.

  These two strategies are known anecdotally as being a "wage slave"; I.E.,
  working until you die. The reason why the AI does not use this strategy
  is because of microeconomic preference relations:

    consumption >~ divesting
    divesting >~ withdrawing
    withdrawing >~ saving
    saving >~ investing
    investing >~ labor

    Where >~ means that "LHS (left-hand-side) is preferable over RHS".

  These microeconmic preference relations are applied in the GAME RULES
  as the Rock-paper-scissors weighting on actions. For an in-depth
  discussion on preference relations, please consult the below reference.

9. CONCLUSION

  Conclusively, although the macroeconomic theory says to maximize
  lifetime welfare, we cannot ignore player preferences. Microeconomic
  theory (human nature) has a strong influence on player actions in the
  real world. Most social planners and professional economists know this
  concept as the following anecdote:

    Economics is 10% mathematics and 90% human nature.

    (Wayne Brown, Undersecratry of Finance, Government of Bermuda, 2014)

10. CHALLENGES

- Chosing the optimal interest and return rates as well as the number turns.
  This was best resolved using numerical experimentation and data from the
  real world. As an example, savings accounts have interest rates below 1%
  and the Dow Jones has average annual growth of 4% over a 20 year period.

- Storing game data for later analysis. Ideally an SQL database should be
  used to allow a rich set of query options.

- Lack of time to port the game to Windows, but it can be run in cygwin.

11. PROPOSED IMPROVEMENTS

- data.h/cpp and analystics.h/cpp libraries to allow the storing and
  evaluation of game data. Ideally an SQL database and GRETL should be
  used. However gnuplot is a secondary option because it can create nice
  graphs.

- Introduce economic shocks such as stock market crashes, a raise
  (payout from labor increases) and medical advances (an increase) in the
  number of turns.

- Simple GUI with 256 color graphics and keyboard interactivity.

- Online play, adding players by IP address.
