SUMMARY

There will only be a command line interface with the card suits and pips
displayed as text. Maximum 5 players, including the bank/house. Players
compete only against the bank and not each other. The number of cards will
be a standard stack of four decks, jokers removed. Once the deck is emptied
it will be reshuffled and stacked again.

NOTE: Quick shuffling will be used, where cards are just randomly selected
out of the deck, to simulate shuffling.

Basic AI for the bank will be to always hit if its total is smaller than 15
or the total of the leading player, whichever is larger (and smaller or equal
to 21).

Aces always count as 11.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

Run the binary titled simply "blackjack"

PLAYING INSTRUCTIONS

On execution the game will prompt for the number of players and then each
player's name. Further instructions will be presented as needed.

PROPOSED IMPROVEMENTS

- Simple GUI with 256 color graphics and keyboard interactivity.
- Bank AI for treating Aces as either 1 or 11.
- Online play, adding players by IP address.
