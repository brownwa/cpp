PROJECT PROPOSAL

The proposed project is Blackjack. There will only be a command line interface
with the card suits and pips displayed as text. Maximum 5 players, including
the bank/house. Players compete only against the bank and not each other. The
number of cards will be a standard stack of four decks, jokers removed. Once
the deck is emptied it will be reshuffled and stacked again.

Basic AI for the bank will be to always hit if its total is smaller than 15
or the total of the leading player, whichever is larger (and smaller or equal
to 21).

Aces always count as 11.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

Run the binary titled simply "blackjack"

PLAYING INSTRUCTIONS

On execution the game will prompt for the number of players and then each
player's name. Further instructions will be presented as needed.
